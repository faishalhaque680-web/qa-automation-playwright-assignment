# QA Automation Assignment – Playwright (JavaScript)

This repository contains UI and API automation tests implemented using Playwright with JavaScript.

## UI Automation
- Login to DemoQA
- Search and validate book
- Extract Title, Author, Publisher

## API Automation
- Create user
- Get user
- Update user

Note:
Clicking on book navigates to a blank page due to DemoQA application defect. Hence validation is done via search results grid.
